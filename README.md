## Introduction

Are you aware of the developments being planned as part of Ashford Borough Council's core plan 2030?

Ashford borough council have now published their revised core plan 2030 and have begun a public consultation which runs to the end of August 2017. The plan outlines which areas they are going to allow development in (both residential and commercial).  Once the council incorporates these areas into its plan it will be impossible to stop development on these sites. For those that live in the rural areas around Ashford especially, this means that much  of the rural landscape, fields  and woodland we all love so much are at risk of being developed into urban housing developments as well as some commercial developments too. 

Information about the plan and all the main changes can be found on the council's website

We urge you to read this, attend the public exhibitions and to comment on the plan where appropriate. These are going to be  far reaching and irreversible changes to the landscape of Ashford and it's surrounds so please get involved and have your say.

## Resident created Google Map

The council have not yet published any maps providing an overview of all the sites, and we as residents felt the need to be able to clearly see the context and the full extent of all the proposed developments, which is why we have been working to create our own google map, which can be viewed here

You can also see the map here:  [click to view in google maps](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.1074543,0.823524,13z/data=!4m2!6m1!1s1eK9Jhuzd8l9kXB0t355LFvCOJMw)


The map is still a work in progress and based on what we can glean from the council website. Also, because it is not an ordinance survey map is not going to be 100% accurate because google doesn't give us land ownership boundaries. But it is good enough - and shows the extent and the cumulative effect. We have focused on the areas of Weald South, Weald East and Saxon Shore because this is where we are from, but we would welcome contributions from anywhere else as this applies to all the surrounding villages of Ashford.

## Map Key

Orange = proposed areas in plan. 
Yellow = rejected omission sites or those that we are unsure of their status
Blue = underway
Pink = under appeal  

Where possible we've tried to use the council's site codes. If you click on each area the code will come up and where we have been able to find the information, the number of homes too. 

Please share the link and Let us know your thoughts - and more importantly let your local councillors and MP know, and most importantly comment on the council website
