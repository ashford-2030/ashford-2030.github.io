## Introduction

Are you aware of the developments being planned as part of ABC's core plan 2030?

Some friends and I have been working on this map to make more people aware of the full extent of proposed developments in and around this area, we'd love to know your thoughts......

As many of you know Ashford borough council are currently working on their core plan  2030 which is due to be published for consultation sometime this summer. This will outline which areas they are going to allow development in (both residential and commercial).  Once the council incorporates these areas into its plan it will be almost impossible to stop development on these sites. For those that live in the areas south of Ashford especially, this means that much  of the rural landscape, fields  and woodland we all love so much are at risk of being developed into urban housing developments as well as some commercial developments too. 

The information from the council site is very scant , disparate and confusing, so we have been spending some time putting it all in one place so that we can get a better overview of what it really means for us. The map is a work in progress and because it is not an ordinance survey map is not going to 100% correct because google doesn't give us land ownership boundaries. But it is good enough - and shows the true extent and the cumulative effect. We have also focused on the areas of Weald South, Weald East and Saxon Shore because this is where we are from but we would welcome contributions from anywhere else as this applies to all the surrounding villages.

Orange depicts areas submitted for inclusion into the plan. 
Yellow - omission sites - submitted as 'late' entries. 
Red - sites such as Chilmington Green already underway. 

Where possible we've tried to use the council's site codes. We are working on trying to display the number of homes each of these sites represent too (which can be found here [http://www.ashford.gov.uk/site-submissions-2013](http://www.ashford.gov.uk/site-submissions-2013)).

Please share the link and Let us know your thoughts - and more importantly let your councillors, political candidates know your thoughts too.

Share the links and information - many people do not yet know the full extent of it but now and whilst the plan is still in draft is the time to object.

The council are supposed to publish their Core Plan 2030 sometime this summer and then a consultation with the people that it affects. They usually run 'roadshows' workshop type days - so this is where we need to be ready and make our voices heard too.

And, if people are up for it - it might be worth starting a petition - such as, calling for a green belt around rural villages and/or more protection for rural villages from urbanisation, and/ or a green belt around the ashford urban area itself to contain urban development ...? We'd be interested to know your thoughts, join us on facebook to discuss.
