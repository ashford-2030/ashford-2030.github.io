## Introduction

Are you aware of the developments being planned as part of ABC's core plan 2030?

Some friends and I have been working on this map to make more people aware of the full extent of proposed developments in and around this area, we'd love to know your thoughts......

As many of you know Ashford borough council are currently working on their core plan  2030 which is due to be published for consultation sometime this summer. This will outline which areas they are going to allow development in (both residential and commercial).  Once the council incorporates these areas into its plan it will be almost impossible to stop development on these sites. For those that live between Ashford and Hamstreet, this means that much  of the rural landscape, fields  and woodland we all love so much is at risk of being developed into urban housing developments as well as some commercial developments too. 

The information from the council site is very scant , disparate and confusing, so we have been spending some time putting it all in one place so that we can get a better overview of what it really means for us. The map is a work in progress and because it is not an ordinance survey map is not going to 100% correct because google doesn't give us land ownership boundaries. But it is good enough - and shows the true extent and the cumulative effect.

Please share the link and Let us know your thoughts - and more importantly let your councillors, political candidates and  MP know your thoughts. There is a general election hustings on 31st May in Ashford - go and ask questions! If we don't make our voices heard now and let ABC put all this land into its plan then we will lose our rural landscape forever.
